Hi! I’m a normal student from China. (I’m starting to suspect this ‘student’ thing is a lifetime subscription — there's just so much to learn in this world!)

I’m lucky enough to be friends with a real, powerful, and magnificent dragon — yes, an actual dragon, not a lizard or a human in disguise. I promise! We still spend great times together. owo

I’ve been playing Minecraft for over ten years now, so it’s safe to say I absolutely love the game.

I enjoy translating Minecraft mods into Chinese — completely for free, and always with my full heart. To me, translation is a beautiful thing. ❤️

I also enjoy helping people figure out those deep, hidden crashes in Minecraft. I’ve shared quite a few crash-solving guides on Bilibili over the years📜. I never charge for it — helping others is also something truly wonderful. :3

Well, my imagination definitely outpaces my coding skills. I know that could hold me back creatively, but I'm going to work hard to make sure that doesn't happen!

_Friendship is magic_ is the best animated show ever!

Right now, I’m dreaming of creating my own game one day🕹️. Hopefully, I can make it happen.
